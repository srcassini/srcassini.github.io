Loved this book. Thank you for the reccomendation {{< rawhtml >}}<a id='mattias' href='https://mattias421.github.io'>Mattias</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. There isn't too much else to say about this one - if you haven't read it, you must.

- Unique story
- Deep characters
- Ecology
- Read it before the film (which actually does it justice)
- Worms
